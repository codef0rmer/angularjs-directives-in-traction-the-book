# AngularJS Directives in Traction

I was extremely busy with my books on AngularJS 1.x since almost 2 years. The first book named [AngularJS UI Development by Packt Publications](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/angularjs-ui-development) was released in October 2014 which has been received quite well. For my second book, [Manning Publications](http://manning.com/) approached me to write a book especially on AngularJS Directives after getting impressed by [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Directive](https://amitgharat.wordpress.com/2013/06/08/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-directive/) blog post. I’m glad that lots of people found the blog post very useful but there were many things that had not been covered and could be added. So I decided to take the responsibility to write this book. However, It has been canceled recently due to the fact that Angular 1.x directives wouldn't have a strong market any longer and spending few more months to finish it off is not worthy as there will not be enough time for marketing because of the advent of Angular 2.0. So with the consent of Manning, I've decided to publish it for free.

Why is that strange title? It's because I am not allowed to use any of the Manning branding such as their "in action" verb or Cover image but I am hopeful that they will be fine with the above title with the prefix "Tr".

Before we jump in, let me take a pleasure to say few good things,

## Packt vs Manning
I am fortunate enough to work with two radically different publishers but great in their own way. I can only say that I really enjoyed the process with both of them and have a good analogy to prove my point on a positive note. I see **Packt Publishing** like a mother who supports, cares, and gives you more freedom on how and what to write about in a book. Even if you make any mistake, she would react such a way that you would not get hurt, instead, encourages you to make an improvement the best possible way. Whereas **Manning Publications** is like a father, still loves you as much as your mother does, but little strict for your own good. He always makes sure that the kid will not get wasted with mother's appreciations and supports, hence, often expects more and better things. There are lots of things one could say when using mother-vs-father analogy but I'll control myself by considering you understood my intentions. So I'll end it with a simple statement, "You can not leave One for the Other".

## Table of Content
There are [good](http://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-Directives-Alex-Vanston-ebook/dp/B00EXNI5Z2/) [books](http://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-Directives-Alex-Vanston-ebook/dp/B00EXNI5Z2/) and lot's of [blog posts](https://github.com/jmcunningham/AngularJS-Learning#directives) (including mine) are written already on AngularJS Directives but I believe Directives are the integral part of AngularJS ecosystem and will be, even in Angular 2.0. So I'll take a shot at it in my style:

1. AngularJS Directives: A forerunner of Web Components
* AngularJS Fundamentals: A Crash Course
* Testing the Beast: Unit testing and E2E testing
* Building your first HTML element using the API
* Understanding Scope in Directives for better context
* Crafting directives to handle Complex Scenarios
* Bringing directives to Life
